task_description: |
    This skill enables a virtual banking agent to assist customers with financial
    inquiries using both English and German tabular data. The agent is capable of extracting
    and interpreting key information from structured tables, such as account balances,
    transaction histories, investment portfolios, and loan details. It processes these tables
    to answer specific user queries, like calculating remaining balances, summarizing spending
    categories, or providing investment return rates. By leveraging tabular data extraction,
    the skill ensures that the banking agent can efficiently and accurately provide
    context-aware responses based on the data provided, offering a professional and seamless
    bilingual experience. The output is always delivered in English, ensuring consistency
    in responses while making it adaptable to both German and English data inputs.
